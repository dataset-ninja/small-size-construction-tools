**Image Dataset for Object Detection of Small Size Construction Tools** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 25086 images with 36030 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *trowel*, *drill*, *hammer*, and other: *wrench*, *grinder*, *saw*, *tacker*, *spanner*, *knife*, *cutter*, *bucket*, and *shovel*.

Images in the Detection of Small Size Construction Tools dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 5640 (22% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Korea Expressway Corporation](https://www.ex.co.kr/eng/) and [Inha University, Korea](https://eng.inha.ac.kr/).
