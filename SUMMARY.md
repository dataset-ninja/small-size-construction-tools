**Image Dataset for Object Detection of Small Size Construction Tools** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the construction industry.

The dataset consists of 25086 images with 36030 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *trowel*, *drill*, *hammer*, and other: *wrench*, *grinder*, *saw*, *tacker*, *spanner*, *knife*, *cutter*, *bucket*, and *shovel*.

Images in the Detection of Small Size Construction Tools dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 5640 (22% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (25086 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Korea Expressway Corporation and Inha University, Korea](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12205-023-1011-2#author-information).
