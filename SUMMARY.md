**Image Dataset for Object Detection of Small Size Construction Tools** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 28687 images with 49189 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *trowel*, *drill*, *grinder*, and other: *wrench*, *hammer*, *saw*, *tacker*, *cutter*, *spanner*, *bucket*, *knife*, and *shovel*.

Images in the Detection of Small Size Construction Tools dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 5636 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (8819 images), *train* (14187 images), and *undefined* (5681 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Korea Expressway Corporation and Inha University, Korea.
