The authors of the **Detection of Small Size Construction Tools** dataset have explored the application of deep-learning techniques to object detection within the construction industry. Unlike previous studies that predominantly focused on outdoor sites and larger equipment, their emphasis was on enhancing safety by detecting small tools commonly used in indoor construction. Recognizing the need for robust datasets to develop effective object detection models for such tools, they undertook the creation of a comprehensive image database.

The dataset is tailored for training object detection models for small-sized construction tools. It encompasses 12 distinct classes of target tools that are typically utilized in indoor construction scenarios. These tools include *bucket*, *cutter*, *drill*, *grinder*, *hammer*, *knife*, *saw*, *shovel*, *spanner*, *tacker*, *trowel*, and *wrench*. The dataset is composed of a substantial collection of 25,084 images, each paired with corresponding label data to facilitate supervised learning.

The images within the dataset were curated with a keen focus on the diversity of the objects. This diversity was achieved by capturing tools of varying shapes, sizes, and colors. The authors also introduced variations in image characteristics, such as resolution, lighting, occlusion, and background, to improve the model's robustness. Of the total images in the dataset, 6258 (25%) were directly captured from real construction sites, contributing to the dataset's authenticity and relevance.

Object annotations for each image were meticulously executed using bounding boxes, which were subsequently saved in text files. The bounding box coordinates were structured as follows: Class, Center X, Center Y, Width, and Height. The "Class" parameter denoted one of the 12 construction tool types, while "Center X" and "Center Y" represented the center coordinates of the bounding box, normalized with respect to the image resolution. "Width" and "Height" indicated the dimensions of the bounding box, also normalized to the image resolution. This comprehensive dataset, meticulously curated and annotated, stands to enable more accurate and effective object detection models for small construction tools in indoor settings.

Note, that the presented version of the dataset has more images than it was claimed in orifinal dataset. This is due to the fact that some images have duplicates because they contain both *train* and *test* labels. Moreover, there is an additional split *undefined* which contains images with no pre-defined splits in the original dataset.
